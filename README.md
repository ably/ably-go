_[Ably](https://ably.com) is the platform that powers synchronized digital experiences in realtime. Whether attending an event in a virtual venue, receiving realtime financial information, or monitoring live car performance data – consumers simply expect realtime digital experiences as standard. Ably provides a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month. Organizations like Bloomberg, HubSpot, Verizon, and Hopin depend on Ably’s platform to offload the growing complexity of business-critical realtime data synchronization at global scale. For more information, see the [Ably documentation](https://ably.com/documentation)._

## Overview
This is a Go client library for Ably. [Supported features](#feature-support) and [known limitations](#known-limitations) are documented here.

## Installation

```bash
~ $ go get -u github.com/ably/ably-go/ably
```

See [Requirements](#requirements)

## Usage
### Using the Realtime API

#### Creating a client

```go
client, err := ably.NewRealtime(ably.WithKey("xxx:xxx"))
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
channel := client.Channels.Get("test")
```

#### Subscribing to events

You may monitor events on connections and channels.

```go
client, err = ably.NewRealtime(
ably.WithKey("xxx:xxx"),
ably.WithAutoConnect(false), // Set this option to avoid missing state changes.
)
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
// Set up connection events handler.
client.Connection.OnAll(func(change ably.ConnectionStateChange) {
        fmt.Printf("Connection event: %s state=%s reason=%s", change.Event, change.Current, change.Reason)
})
// Then connect.
client.Connect()
channel = client.Channels.Get("test")
channel.OnAll(func(change ably.ChannelStateChange) {
        fmt.Printf("Channel event event: %s channel=%s state=%s reason=%s", channel.Name, change.Event, change.Current, change.Reason)
})
```

#### Subscribing to a channel for all messages

```go
unsubscribe, err := channel.SubscribeAll(ctx, func(msg *ably.Message) {
        fmt.Printf("Received message: name=%s data=%v\n", msg.Name, msg.Data)
})
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Subscribing to a channel for `EventName1` and `EventName2` message names

```go
unsubscribe1, err := channel.Subscribe(ctx, "EventName1", func(msg *ably.Message) {
        fmt.Printf("Received message: name=%s data=%v\n", msg.Name, msg.Data)
})
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
unsubscribe2, err := channel.Subscribe(ctx, "EventName2", func(msg *ably.Message) {
        fmt.Printf("Received message: name=%s data=%v\n", msg.Name, msg.Data)
})
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Publishing to a channel

```go
err = channel.Publish(ctx, "EventName1", "EventData1")
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

`Publish` will block until either the publish is acknowledged or failed to
deliver.

Alternatively you can use `PublishAsync` which does not block:

```go
channel.PublishAsync("EventName1", "EventData11", func(err error) {
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("failed to publish", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("publish ok")
	}
})
```

Note the `onAck` callback must not block as it would block the internal client.

#### Handling errors

Errors returned by this library may have an underlying `*ErrorInfo` type.

[See Ably documentation for ErrorInfo.](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/types#error-info)

```go
badClient, err := ably.NewRealtime(ably.WithKey("invalid:key"))
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
err = badClient.Channels.Get("test").Publish(ctx, "event", "data")
if errInfo := (*ably.ErrorInfo)(nil); errors.As(err, &errInfo) {
        fmt.Printf("Error publishing message: code=%v status=%v cause=%v", errInfo.Code, errInfo.StatusCode, errInfo.Cause)
} else if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Announcing presence on a channel

```go
err = channel.Presence.Enter(ctx, "presence data")
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Announcing presence on a channel on behalf of other client

```go
err = channel.Presence.EnterClient(ctx, "clientID", "presence data")
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Updating and leaving presence

```go
// Update also has an UpdateClient variant.
err = channel.Presence.Update(ctx, "new presence data")
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
// Leave also has an LeaveClient variant.
err = channel.Presence.Leave(ctx, "last presence data")
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Getting all clients present on a channel

```go
clients, err := channel.Presence.Get(ctx)
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
for _, client := range clients {
        fmt.Println("Present client:", client)
}
```

#### Subscribing to all presence messages

```go
unsubscribe, err = channel.Presence.SubscribeAll(ctx, func(msg *ably.PresenceMessage) {
        fmt.Printf("Presence event: action=%v data=%v", msg.Action, msg.Data)
})
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Subscribing to 'Enter' presence messages only

```go
unsubscribe, err = channel.Presence.Subscribe(ctx, ably.PresenceActionEnter, func(msg *ably.PresenceMessage) {
        fmt.Printf("Presence event: action=%v data=%v", msg.Action, msg.Data)
})
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

### Using the REST API

#### Introduction

All examples assume a client and/or channel has been created as follows:

```go
client, err := ably.NewREST(ably.WithKey("xxx:xxx"))
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
channel := client.Channels.Get("test")
```

#### Publishing a message to a channel

```go
err = channel.Publish(ctx, "HelloEvent", "Hello!")
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
// You can also publish multiple messages in a single request.
err = channel.PublishMultiple(ctx, []*ably.Message{
        {Name: "HelloEvent", Data: "Hello!"},
        {Name: "ByeEvent", Data: "Bye!"},
})
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
// A REST client can publish messages on behalf of another client
// by providing the connection key of that client.
err := channel.Publish(ctx, "temperature", "12.7", ably.PublishWithConnectionKey("connectionKeyOfAnotherClient"))
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Querying the History

```go
pages, err := channel.History().Pages(ctx)
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
for pages.Next(ctx) {
        for _, message := range pages.Items() {
                fmt.Println(message)
        }
}
if err := pages.Err(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Presence on a channel

```go
pages, err := channel.Presence.Get().Pages(ctx)
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
for pages.Next(ctx) {
        for _, presence := range pages.Items() {
                fmt.Println(presence)
        }
}
if err := pages.Err(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Querying the Presence History

```go
pages, err := channel.Presence.History().Pages(ctx)
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
for pages.Next(ctx) {
        for _, presence := range pages.Items() {
                fmt.Println(presence)
        }
}
if err := pages.Err(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Fetching your application's stats

```go
pages, err := client.Stats().Pages(ctx)
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
for pages.Next(ctx) {
        for _, stat := range pages.Items() {
                fmt.Println(stat)
        }
}
if err := pages.Err(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```

#### Getting the channel status
```go
status, err := channel.Status(ctx)
if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
fmt.Print(status, status.ChannelId)
```
## Note on ablytest package
Although `ablytest` package ia available as a part of `ably`, we do not recommend using it as a sandbox for your own testing, since it's specifically intended for client library SDKs.
It can lead to flaky nature of tests, considering some beta features can be deployed on the `sandbox` environment so that they can be tested before going into production.

You should rather use, `ablyRealtimeClient` by passing the `ABLY_KEY`, which would be using a more stable ably prod environment.

```
client, err := ably.NewRealtime(ably.WithKey("xxx:xxx"))
```

## Requirements
### Supported Versions of Go

Whenever a new version of Go is released, Ably adds support for that version. The [Go Release Policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy) supports the last two major versions. This SDK follows the same policy of supporting the last two major versions of Go.

### Breaking API Changes in Version 1.2.x

Please see our [Upgrade / Migration Guide](UPDATING.md) for notes on changes you need to make to your code to update it to use the new API introduced by version 1.2.x.

Users updating from version 1.1.5 of this library will note that there are significant breaking changes to the API.
Our [current approach to versioning](https://ably.com/documentation/client-lib-development-guide/versioning) is not compliant with semantic versioning, which is why these changes are breaking despite presenting only a change in the `minor` component of the version number.

## Feature support

This library targets the Ably 1.2 [client library specification](https://ably.com/docs/client-lib-development-guide/features). List of available features for our client library SDKs can be found on our [feature support matrix](https://ably.com/download/sdk-feature-support-matrix) page.

## Known limitations

As of release 1.2.0, the following are not implemented and will be covered in future 1.2.x releases. If there are features that are currently missing that are a high priority for your use-case then please [contact Ably customer support](https://ably.com/support). Pull Requests are also welcomed.

### REST API

- [Push notifications admin API](https://ably.com/docs/general/push/admin) is not implemented.

- [JWT authentication](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt-process) is not implemented.

### Realtime API

- There is no channel `suspended` state; this means that the client will not automatically reattach to channels if a
  connection becomes `suspended` and then resumes, and presence members associated with the client will not be
  automatically re-entered.

- Inband reauthentication is not supported; expiring tokens will trigger a disconnection and resume of a realtime
  connection.

- Realtime connection failure handling is partially implemented.

- Realtime Ping function is not implemented.

- Message Delta Compression is not implemented.

- Push Notification Target functional is not applicable for the SDK and thus not implemented.
