## [v1.2.3](https://github.com/ably/ably-go/tree/v1.2.3) (2021-10-27)

Sorry for the noise but we made a mistake when we released version 1.2.2 of this library. :facepalm:

The `v1.2.2` tag was pushed against the wrong commit, meaning that the library was announcing itself as at version 1.2.1 to the Ably service.
This release (assuming we get the tag push right this time :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) will correctly identify itself as version 1.2.3.
